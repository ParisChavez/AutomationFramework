# AutomationFramework
Automation framework based on Nunit and Selenium, written in C#

My attempt at creating a test framwork that can support API and UI test cases, while remaining modular, emphasizing behavior based test scripts, and eliminating unhelpful failure messages.

This has been created for my own educational and experimental purposes, and is not related to any company or organization.  It may be broken at any point.
